This project involves a fictional school district. I analyzed the math and reading scores and the budgets of the 15 district schools using Python and Pandas.

The report includes the following:

### District Summary

* Key district metrics:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
